# Greetings.
I am Anakama. I make, batch scripts, speedruns and mods. 

I mainly use Github for my coding projects and websites which are mostly private.

I mostly code in: batch, HTML and CSS. (I *used* to code a bit in assembly, not anymore.)

<sub>Statistics are kind of buggy and misses a few hundred commits and hundred thousand lines of code.</sub>
